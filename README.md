PurpurClient is a Fabric client mod that aims to fix various client-side bugs in the game. A lot of these bugfixes end up in the vanilla game eventually, but for those who can't wait, this mod is for you.

PurpurClient is designed to work together with [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur) servers (hence the name), but most features can still be used with any server type, as these are fixes to vanilla bugs that are not caused by Purpur itself.

### Current Features in 1.20.6:

* Customizable mob passenger offsets
* Adds bee counts inside beehives to debug screen¹
* Fancy Purpur-themed Loading Screen (can be disabled in the config)
* Fancy Window Title that changes based on what kind of server you're in ([translations can be PR'd](./src/main/resources/assets/purpurclient/lang/))
* Removes the client-side limit of 255 levels

¹ only works when connected to [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur) servers

### Past Features (to get an idea of what this mod has done and will do in the future):

* Asynchronous chat processing (removed since Mojang's new chat system is confusing)
* Fix rain particles appearing under water [MC-131770](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-131770)
* Fix sky darkening when riding minecart not on tracks [MC-51150](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-51150)
* Fix chat stutter [MC-218167](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-218167)
* Fix warnings in logs about invalid flying attributes [Purpur-744](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur/pull/744)
* Fix debug markers ignoring the blue and red values that are set [MC-234030](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-234030) (Shows as Unresolved even though it's been fixed)
* Fix client preemptively removing item entities from the world (MC-???)
* Displays Custom Enchantments instead of stripping them from the client (1.20.5 - the Components Update)

Note: PurpurClient adds a fancy animated splash screen on game startup alongside a better window title message. Both of these can be disabled in the config if preferred.
